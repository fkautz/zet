# Font Selection for Terminal and Programming

I took a look at several programming fonts today. My default on the terminal was Monaco (default from OS X).

Monaco has three incarnations. 
In early versions it was difficult to tell the difference between 0, O or I,l,| in code.
Newer versions solved this issue, but there are many other programming fonts which were more readable to me.
This is a personal preference, so I am not trying to claim Monaco is a bad font.

I compared Hack (variant of Deja Vu, which are excellent), Go, and Jetbrains NL (No Ligatures).

I **really** disliked the ligatures in Jetbrains.
While they are beautifully done, they reduce the overall information for me.
I'm sure this is a minor problem where I can just learn what ligatures actually map to.
However, I want to minimize the chance of misinterpretation.

Go fonts are also beautifully done.
The Go fonts are available in 'Regular', non-mono sans-serif and are also available in mono serif.
It is a no-frills font.
Overall, the font feels a bit cluttered compared to Jetbrains NL.

Among the three, I personally like the look and feel of Jetbrains NL.
So, I will be using this as my main font.
